This project was my first exploration into not only ray-tracing but also vector math. Euclidian vectors are fully supported by NumPy and were the structure of choice for this application. This program applies the minimal ray tracing algorithm given an eye position and a defined sphere object(s). It results in the computation of ray intersections which are visualized in the terminal. As you can see, the output crudely but accurately illustrates a two dimensional rendering of the 3d sphere objects.

The parameters (position, radius) for the sphere objects are defined in the code.

Run python3 main.py
